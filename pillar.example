# Apart from the various source files, there are two independent source trees
# for user-specific configuration.
# Generally tool_mas > tool_global.
# `tool_global` focuses on specific users, of which most values
# will be respected by all formulae in the `tool` suite:
tool_global:
  users:

      # The following is global configuration for the user named `user`.
    user:

        # Persist environment variables used by this formula for this
        # user to this file (will be appended to a file relative to $HOME)
      persistenv: '.config/zsh/zshenv'

        # Add runcom hooks specific to this formula to this file
        # for this user (will be appended to a file relative to $HOME)
      rchook: '.config/zsh/zshrc'

        # This user's configuration for this formula. Will be overridden by
        # user-specific configuration in `tool_mas:users`.
        # Set this to `false` to disable configuration for this user.

tool_mas:

    # Specify an explicit version (works on most Linux distributions) or
    # keep the packages updated to their latest version on subsequent runs
    # by leaving version empty or setting it to 'latest'
    # (again for Linux, brew does that anyways).
  version: latest

    # Default formula configuration for all users.

    # User configuration can also be specified here in
    # `tool_mas:users`. It will override
    # configuration sourced from `tool_global:users`.
